#Introduction
This document describes the requirements of the online video chat project. It is a web service that will allow multiple users to communicate in real time via video calls. The service will be accessible via a web browser on a computer or mobile device.

##the project's objectives
Offer a real-time communication solution to multiple users via video calls
Allow access to the service via a web browser on a computer or mobile device
Provide a simple and intuitive interface to initiate and receive video calls
Ensure the security and confidentiality of communications
Service Features
The online video chat service will offer the following features:

##Login to a user account with authentication
Adding and managing contacts
Initiate a video call to one or more contacts
Reception of a video call with the possibility of answering or refusing the call
Real-time communication with audio and video transmission
Screen sharing
Instant messaging during the video call
Pausing the video call
End of video call
Project techniques
The online video chat service will use the following technologies:

Database: A relational database will be used to store user information (username, password, contact list, etc.) as well as session data (session ID, login information, etc.).

Back-end: the back-end of the service will be developed using a server-side programming language, such as python, and will be based on a web framework for managing HTTP requests and communicating with the database.

Front-end: The front-end of the service will be developed using a client-side programming language, such as JavaScript, and will rely on a front-end framework, such as React or Angular, for UI management and communication with the back-end via an API.

API: an API (Application Programming Interface) will be used to allow communication between the front-end and the back-end of the service. This API will expose different methods to perform actions, like initiating a video call or sending a message


Description of methods exposed by the API: For each action the user can perform through the service (such as initiating a video call or sending a message), you should describe the method exposed by the API that will be used to perform that action , along with expected parameters and expected results. For example, you might have a "startVideoCall" method that references a list of user IDs and returns a unique ID for the current video call.
API Security: You should describe the security measures in place to protect the API and the data it handles. For example, you could use access token authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the API.
Error handling: You should describe how the API handles errors that may occur while executing the various methods. For example, you could return an error code and an error message when one of the parameters is missing or incorrect.
It is also important to specify how the API will be used by the front-end of the service. For example, you should describe how the front-end will make API calls to initiate and receive video calls, send messages, etc.

I also recommend that you describe any constraints or limitations related to the use of the API, for example if it can only be used on a secure protocol (HTTPS) or if it is subject to a limitation on the number of calls per unit of time.
